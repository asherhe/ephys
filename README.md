# ephys

A simple 2d rigidbody (not yet) physics engine partially based off of the book [Game Physics Engine Development](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Physics-Engine-Development-Commercial-Grade/dp/0123819768).

As of now I have implemented particle physics with plans to implement rigidbody physics by before February.

## Features

- particles!
  - particle forces!
  - particle contacts!
- rigidbodies!
  - newton's laws!
  - forces!

## Roadmap

- collision detection system(!!!)
