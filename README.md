# ephys

A simple 2d rigidbody (not yet) physics engine partially based off of the book [Game Physics Engine Development](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Physics-Engine-Development-Commercial-Grade/dp/0123819768).

As of now I have implemented particle physics with plans to implement rigidbody physics by before February.

## Features

- not much actually
- just
- stuff with particles
- there's collision resolution so that's cool

## Roadmap

- implement rigid body physics
- collision detection system
