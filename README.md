# ephys

A simple 2d rigidbody physics engine inspired by [cyclone physics](https://github.com/idmillington/cyclone-physics/) ([Game Physics Engine Development](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Physics-Engine-Development-Commercial-Grade/dp/0123819768)).

## Features

- particle system!
  - particle constraints!
- rigidbodies!
  - circles!
  - rectangles!
- reasonably fast collision detection!

## Roadmap

- collision resolution
